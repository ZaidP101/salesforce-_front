# Salesforce Website Landing Page

This project is a practice exercise where I created the first page of a Salesforce website using HTML and CSS. The primary goal was to enhance my skills in front-end web development, focusing on HTML structure and CSS styling.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The page layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Navigation Bar:** A simple, user-friendly navigation bar at the top of the page.
- **Hero Section:** A prominent hero section with a background image and text overlay.
- **Content Sections:** Structured sections for showcasing features, benefits, and a call-to-action.
- **Footer:** A basic footer with links to additional resources.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the page.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.
